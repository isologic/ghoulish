[ghoulish](https://github.com/isologic/ghoulish.git)
========

Starter theme for the [Ghost](http://ghost.org) blogging platform integrated with [Gumby Framework](http://gumbyframework.com) (v2.6), modified to utilize only its semantic mixin functions. Original core starter theme files forked from [loremipson/spectral](https://github.com/loremipson/spectral), a perfect combination of simplicity and extensibility for those looking to develop their own framework for Ghost with the head start of a pre-existing core scaffolding.

[Spectral](https://github.com/loremipson/spectral) is a very simple starter theme for Ghost that utilizes [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) compiling and [LiveReloading](http://livereload.com). Ghoulish takes it a step further by extending SASS with [Compass](http://compass-style.com), and integrating all of the fantastic core components of the Gumby Framework.
